# Healthcare Dataset Visualization in Tableau

## Overview
This project involves merging and visualizing two healthcare datasets: `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv` and `cardio_train.csv` using Tableau. The datasets contain information related to cardiovascular health and stroke risk factors. By creating a dashboard and multiple charts in Tableau, we aim to gain insights into the data and identify patterns or correlations that may exist between different variables.

## Datasets
- **healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv:** Contains data related to stroke risk factors, including age, hypertension, heart disease, etc.
- **cardio_train.csv:** Includes cardiovascular health data, such as age, gender, height, weight, cholesterol levels, etc.

## Visualization Goals
- Merge the two datasets based on common attributes to create a comprehensive dataset.
- Create a Tableau dashboard to visualize various aspects of the merged dataset.
- Utilize multiple charts and visualizations to explore relationships between different variables.
- Identify trends, correlations, and insights related to cardiovascular health and stroke risk factors.

## Tableau Visualizations
- **Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard providing an overview of key metrics and trends.
- **Bar Charts:** Visualizing distribution of age, gender, and other categorical variables.
- **Scatter Plots:** Exploring relationships between age, cholesterol levels, BMI, and other numerical variables.
- **Pie Charts:** Displaying proportions of different categories such as hypertension, heart disease, and stroke occurrence.

## Insights and Analysis
- Analyze the distribution of stroke risk factors and cardiovascular health indicators.
- Identify correlations between demographic factors (age, gender) and health outcomes.
- Explore potential relationships between lifestyle factors (BMI, smoking) and health conditions.
- Provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers based on the visualizations.

## Conclusion
Through the use of Tableau visualizations, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of cardiovascular health and stroke risk factors. By exploring the merged datasets and creating insightful visualizations, we can gain valuable insights that may inform healthcare decision-making and interventions.
