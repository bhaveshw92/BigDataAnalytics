# Dataset Exploration Project Part 4 – Inferential Techniques & Final Report

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the Math for Data Analysis course, focusing on inferential techniques and the completion of the final report covering all steps of dataset exploration. The project follows the guidelines provided for Dataset Exploration Project Part 4 (DE pt4) and includes comprehensive analysis and reporting.

## Table of Contents

1. **Dataset Description**
   - Provides an overview of the dataset used for the project, including its source and characteristics.

2. **Research Questions**
   - Lists the research questions defined for the analysis, along with any modifications made during the course of the project:
        Q1. Does the person's age affect the risk of stroke. OR (Age ∝ Stroke)?
        Q2. Is stroke influenced by gender?
        Q.3 What is the impact of the type of work they do on stroke risk?
        Q4. Can smoking increase the risk of stroke?


3. **Dataset Resource Link**

4. **Dataset Dictionary**
   - Provides a dictionary of variables present in the dataset, including their definitions and data types.

5. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Describes the univariate analysis performed on each variable in the dataset, including examination for inappropriate values, frequency distributions, and visualizations.

6. **Bi- and Multi-variate Analysis**
   - Discusses the bi- and multi-variate analysis techniques applied to explore relationships between variables in the dataset.

7. **Regression Analysis and Forecasting**
   - Presents regression analysis and forecasting techniques used to address research questions, including methodology, results, and visualizations.

8. **Conclusion**
   - Summarizes the findings of the analysis, discusses the implications for the original research questions, and identifies any limitations or areas for further investigation.

9. **Appendices**
   - Includes analysis tracking, references, and any additional materials used in the project.

## Usage

1. **Review the Final Report**
   - Read the MS Word document containing the final report to understand the complete analysis process and findings.

2. **Examine the Excel Spreadsheet**
   - Explore the Excel spreadsheet provided to examine the data manipulation, analysis, and visualization steps taken during the project.

3. **Refer to Appendices for Reproducibility**
   - Check the appendices section of the report for analysis tracking and references, enabling replication of the analysis by other data analysts.
