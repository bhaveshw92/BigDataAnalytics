# Sqoop and Hive Assignment

This repository contains the solutions and documentation for the Sqoop and Hive assignment. The assignment involves using Sqoop to transfer data between MySQL and HDFS, and using Hive to upload an XML file to HDFS, create a table, and execute queries.

## Task 1: Sqoop Data Transfer

### Objective
The objective of this task is to demonstrate the use of Sqoop to transfer data between MySQL and HDFS.

#### Subtasks
1. **Import Table from MySQL to HDFS**
   - Import a table from MySQL to HDFS using Sqoop. Choose suitable parameters for the import operation.

2. **Export Data from HDFS to MySQL**
   - Demonstrate the export command to transfer data from HDFS to MySQL.

### Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting issues encountered during the Sqoop data transfer process is a crucial part of this evaluation. Ensure to research and troubleshoot any issues that arise during the tasks.

## Task 2: Hive Data Processing

### Objective
The objective of this task is to use Hive for processing XML data.

#### Subtasks
A. **Upload and Parse XML File in Hive**
   - Upload the Book.xml file to HDFS.
   - Create a table in Hive and parse the XML data.

B. **Run Queries in Hive**
   - Execute three queries of your choice in Hive, such as displaying all authors from the parsed XML data.

### Note
Processing XML data in Hive using XML SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer) is a significant aspect of this assignment. While Hive does not have built-in support for XML data processing, various open-source contributions, like XML SerDe, facilitate XML data processing in Hive.
