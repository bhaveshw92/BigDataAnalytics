# Linux Commands Demonstration

This project demonstrates basic Linux commands performed on a virtual machine (VM) or EC2 instance. 
It was completed as part of a PG Diploma Program to showcase proficiency in Linux systems administration.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to run and demonstrate fundamental Linux commands.

## Steps

1. **Connect to VM and Configure Putty Settings**

   - `scp`: Securely copy files between hosts.

3. **Create and Verify File Contents**
   - Use `vi` to create a file with the content "Hello Group x".
   - Verify the file contents using the `cat` command.

4. **Transfer File Using WinSCP**
   - Use WinSCP to transfer a file to the Linux VM.

5. **Create and Log in with New User**
   - Create a new user with a password.
   - Log in with the new username using `sudo`.

6. **Modify File Permissions**
   - Create a file and modify its permissions to full permission.

8. **Install and Remove a Package**
   - Install a package (e.g., HTTP).
   - Remove the installed package.

9. **Setup Local Repository**
   - Create a `local.repo` file and ensure its functionality.
   - Explain the purpose of a local repository.

10. **Upgrade VM to GUI**
    - Upgrade the VM to a graphical user interface (GUI) from the command line.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the README to reproduce the project on your system.
