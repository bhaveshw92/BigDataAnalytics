**README: Kafka Messaging Scenarios with Scala**

---

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate various Kafka messaging scenarios using Scala programming language. Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that enables the exchange of real-time data between multiple applications and systems. The project explores three distinct scenarios, each showcasing different aspects of Kafka's capabilities.

### Scenario Description

Steps involved in the scenarios:
1. Continue with the previously installed and set up Kafka environment.
2. Develop Scala code for the App Producer to produce messages within the Scala application and send them to the Kafka topic.
3. Implement Scala code for the App Consumer and Initiator to consume messages from the Kafka topic and process them within the Scala application.

### Project Components

1. **Initiator.scala**: Scala code for initiating message consumption and processing.
2. **KafkaSampleConsumer.scala**: Scala code for consuming messages from the Kafka topic.
3. **KafkaSampleProducer.scala**: Scala code for producing messages to the Kafka topic.

### Project Structure

1. **Scala Code Files**:
   - `Initiator.scala`
   - `KafkaSampleConsumer.scala`
   - `KafkaSampleProducer.scala`

2. **Kafka Setup Instructions**
   - Installation steps for Kafka and Zookeeper
   - Configuration of Kafka brokers
   - Creation of Kafka topics

3. **Demonstration Video**
   - Recorded video showcasing the execution of each scenario

4. **Report**
   - Includes screenshots with timestamps
   - Detailed report describing of steps performed and observed outputs

### Project Execution

- Set up Kafka environment locally.
- Run the Scala code files to demonstrate Kafka messaging scenarios.
- Verify the message exchange between the producer and consumer components.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates proficiency in using Scala with Kafka to implement various messaging scenarios. It includes necessary configurations to connect to Kafka brokers, define topics, and enable message exchange between the producer and consumer components.
