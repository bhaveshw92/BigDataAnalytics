### AWS - Domain 4 - Analysis

---

## Project Overview:

The final project for the Data Collection and Curation course covers a comprehensive exploration of various AWS services and machine learning concepts. The project is structured into two parts, focusing on Redshift architecture, machine learning models, and practical labs using AWS SageMaker Studio.

### Part 1:

1. **Redshift Architecture:**
   - Understanding Redshift in the AWS Ecosystem
   - Introduction to Columnar Databases
   - Redshift Table Design:
     - Distribution Styles
     - Sort Keys
     - Data Types
     - Compression
     - Constraints
     - Loading Data
     - Maintenance and Operations

2. **Machine Learning Introduction:**
   - Overview of machine learning concepts on AWS
   - Introduction to multiclass classification, binary classification, and regression models

3. **Elasticsearch and Athena:**
   - Overview and application of Elasticsearch for data querying and analysis
   - Introduction to Athena for serverless query execution on data stored in S3

### Part 2: Lab Implementation:

**Lab Title:** Deploy a Regression Model through AWS SageMaker Studio using Autopilot

**Lab Description:**
- Utilizing Amazon SageMaker Studio and Autopilot to create a machine learning model for predicting house prices.
- Steps include uploading dataset to Amazon S3, setting up SageMaker domain, importing dataset, preprocessing, creating Autopilot experiment, deploying ML model, and invoking the deployed model.
- Dataset used: [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/rules)
