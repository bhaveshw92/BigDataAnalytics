**SQL Movie Database Creation**

This repository contains SQL scripts to create a movie database with tables for directors, movies, actors, ratings, and more. Below is a summary of the SQL commands and queries included in this project:

### Database Creation and Schema Setup
1. Create a database named "Movies".
2. Create a schema named "mov" under the "Movies" database.

### Table Creation
3. Create a table called "Movie_Director" under the "mov" schema to store director information.
4. Create a table called "Movies" under the "mov" schema to store movie information.
5. Create a table called "Movie_Actor" under the "mov" schema to store actor information.
6. Create a table called "Movie_Rating" under the "mov" schema to store movie rating information.

### Data Insertion
7. Insert records into the "Movie_Director" table with specified constraints and default values.
8. Insert records into the "Movies" table with specified constraints and default values.
9. Insert records into the "Movie_Actor" table with specified constraints and default values.
10. Insert records into the "Movie_Rating" table with specified constraints and default values.

### Data Querying
11. Perform various queries to retrieve information from the database, such as listing movies, directors, actors, and ratings based on different criteria.
12. Write complex queries to join multiple tables and retrieve related information.
13. Retrieve database metadata, such as table sizes, primary and foreign keys, nullable columns, constraints, and more.

### Data Manipulation
14. Perform data manipulation operations, such as updating movie ratings, increasing actor and director ages, deleting records, and creating views.

### View Creation
15. Create views to display specific information from the tables, such as movie details, ratings, actors, directors, and more.

### Database Inspection
16. Retrieve information about the database structure, including database names, table sizes, primary and foreign keys, nullable columns, constraints, and more.

These SQL scripts demonstrate proficiency in SQL database creation, schema setup, table creation, data insertion, querying, manipulation, view creation, and database inspection.
