# Business Intelligence Course Project

## Overview

This repository contains the project work completed as part of the Business Intelligence course, focusing on transformation, M coding, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI. The project encompasses various tasks related to data transformation, analysis, and visualization using Power Query and DAX functions.

## Part 1: Transformation and M coding in Power Query

1. **Capture Current DateTime**: Implemented M code in Power Query to capture the current datetime.

2. **Create ID Columns**: Generated ID columns (ID1, ID2, ID3) against Full Name using M code, with specified increment rules.

3. **Extract Name Components**: Extracted First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name from the "Full Name" column using Power Query.

4. **Extract Date**: Extracted Date from the DateKey column using Power Query.

5. **Parameterize Server and Database**: Created parameters to input Server and Database names and imported the 'Product' table using Power Query.

6. **Convert Table to Matrix**: Transformed a table to a matrix structure using Power Query.

7. **Combine Tables**: Combined records from "StudentFromLocationA" and "StudentFromLocationB" tables using Power Query.

8. **Merge Tables**: Merged records from the "Student" table with "Department" using Power Query.

9. **Extract Data from Excel**: Loaded data from the "2020-monthly-visitor-statistics.xlsx" file into Power BI and applied Power Query transformation to extract specific data.

10. **Transform Dataset**: Performed Power Query transformations on a given dataset.

## Part 2: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

1. **Sort Month Name**: Sorted month names using DAX in Power BI.

2. **Capture Slicer Values**: Captured selected values from slicer and displayed them using card visuals.

3. **Extract Item Information**: Extracted Item name, Item ID, and Price from the "Item Description" column using DAX.

4. **Calculate Budget Cost**: Calculated the sum of Budget cost based on specified conditions using DAX.

5. **Calculate MAX Value**: Calculated the MAX value after multiplying with a constant using DAX.

6. **Add Rank Columns**: Added rank columns based on specified criteria using RankX function in DAX.

7. **Visualize Sales Data**: Created a bar graph to visualize month-on-month sales data for previous and present years.

8. **Filter Rows**: Created a new table by filtering rows based on specified criteria using DAX.

9. **Visualize Sales Metrics**: Created a bar graph with swapping axis options for profit, sales, or quantity based on a slicer parameter.

10. **Generate Calendar Table**: Generated a calendar table with date-related columns using DAX.
